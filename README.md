## Usage

### Object Detection with Faster R-CNN

Faster R-CNN is a state-of-the-art model for object detection that integrates region proposal networks with convolutional neural networks, enabling efficient and accurate detection.

To utilize Faster R-CNN in this project:

1. Navigate to the `OD.ipynb` notebook.
2. Follow the steps to load and preprocess the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset.
3. Train the Faster R-CNN model on the dataset.
4. Evaluate and visualize detection results.

### Image Segmentation with U-Net

U-Net is a convolutional network designed for biomedical image segmentation, known for its U-shaped architecture that allows for precise localization.

To implement U-Net in this project:

1. Open the `segmentation.ipynb` notebook.
2. Follow the instructions to preprocess the dataset for segmentation tasks.
3. Train the U-Net model on the prepared data.
4. Assess model performance and visualize segmentation outputs.

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

The project includes a GUI for visualizing the results of object detection and segmentation models. This interface allows users to interactively explore the outcomes of the models applied to the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset.
